# `Typescript Objects To Cs` converter

### What
Creating Typescript to AST parser, to work with TS AST in similar way as people doing it in Roslyn analyzers. 
(and reuse Roslyns types and logic as much as possible)

### Why
Want to parse TS files with plain classes/interfaces with data to C# classes (or plain JSON for data + C# classes for models)
